# My Blog Project: A Custom Next.js and MDX Blog

This document provides an overview of my personal blog project, a modern and dynamic blogging platform I built from scratch using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**. Designed to showcase my content creation skills, this project combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components to create an engaging, SEO-friendly, and responsive blog.

## Project Overview

My blog is a custom-built platform for sharing articles, tutorials, and personal stories. I developed it to explore modern web development technologies while creating a space for my ideas. The project uses **Next.js** for its server-side rendering and static site generation, **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling, and **MDX** for flexible content authoring. With only four blog posts (including topics like photography in Canada and technical guides), the platform is lightweight yet powerful.

## Key Features

Here are the core features I implemented in my blog:

### 1. MDX for Dynamic Content
- I used **MDX**, a combination of Markdown and JSX, to write blog posts that support both simple text formatting and interactive React components.
- Example: Embedding a custom button in a post:

```jsx
import { Button } from '../components/Button';

# My Post
Here's a custom button: <Button>Click Me!</Button>
```

- MDX files include frontmatter for metadata like title, date, and tags, stored in the `/data/blog` folder.

### 2. Content Management
- I organized blog posts in a dedicated `/data/blog` folder, where each post is an MDX file.
- A custom content processing system parses MDX files and generates static pages using Next.js's static site generation (SSG).

### 3. SEO and Performance
- I implemented **SEO metadata** (e.g., title, description) in each post to improve search engine visibility.
- The blog achieves high **Lighthouse scores** for performance and accessibility.
- I added support for **RSS feeds** to make content easily accessible to subscribers.

### 4. Tailwind CSS Styling
- I chose **Tailwind CSS** for its utility-first approach, allowing me to create a responsive and modern design.
- The blog supports **light and dark themes**, toggled automatically based on user preferences.
- Custom styles are defined in a `styles/tailwind.css` file, with configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

### 5. Image Optimization
- Images are optimized using Next.js's **Image** component, ensuring fast load times.
- All images are stored in the `/public/images` folder and referenced in MDX files, like:

```markdown
![Photography in Canada](/images/canada.jpg)
```

### 6. Responsive Layouts
- I designed multiple layouts for blog posts, including a standard layout with a sidebar and a simple layout for minimalistic posts.
- The homepage features a list of all posts with tags for easy navigation.

### 7. Code Highlighting
- I integrated **Prism.js** for server-side syntax highlighting of code blocks in MDX files.
- Example of a JavaScript code block:

```javascript
// A sample function
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### 8. Search Functionality
- I implemented a local search feature using a JSON-based index of posts, allowing users to quickly find content.
- The search is accessible via a dialog box triggered by a keyboard shortcut.

## Project Structure

I organized the project with a clean and modular structure:

- **`/app`**: Contains Next.js pages and layouts for the App Router.
- **`/components`**: Custom React components, including reusable elements like buttons and alerts for MDX files.
- **`/data/blog`**: Stores MDX files for blog posts.
- **`/public`**: Holds static assets like images and favicon.
- **`/styles`**: Includes Tailwind CSS styles and Prism.js for code highlighting.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configures Tailwind CSS with custom themes and typography.

## How I Built the Blog

1. **Setup Next.js**:
   - I initialized a Next.js project with the App Router for modern routing and server components.
   - Configured static site generation (SSG) for blog posts to ensure fast performance.

2. **Integrated MDX**:
   - Added `@next/mdx` to process MDX files.
   - Created custom components to enhance MDX content, like buttons and alerts.

3. **Styled with Tailwind CSS**:
   - Installed Tailwind CSS and customized the theme to match my vision.
   - Designed responsive layouts for desktop and mobile devices.

4. **Content Creation**:
   - Wrote four blog posts, including one about photography in Canada and a technical guide on MDX.
   - Used frontmatter to organize metadata for each post.

5. **Development Workflow**:
   - Used `npm run dev` to test the blog locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Tested responsiveness and performance with browser developer tools.

## Example Post

Here's an example of how I structured an MDX post:

```mdx

# Photography in Canada

This post showcases my favorite photos from Canada.

```

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Rendering MDX files efficiently.
  - **Solution**: Used `@next/mdx` with static generation to pre-render posts at build time.
- **Challenge**: Creating a responsive design.
  - **Solution**: Leveraged Tailwind CSS's utility classes to ensure compatibility across devices.
- **Challenge**: Optimizing images for fast loading.
  - **Solution**: Used Next.js Image component with lazy loading and automatic format conversion.

## Conclusion

This blog project is a reflection of my skills in modern web development. By combining **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**, I created a fast, responsive, and content-rich platform for sharing my ideas. The project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application from scratch, manage content effectively, and optimize for performance and SEO. I plan to expand the blog with more posts and features in the future.

Thank you for exploring my project!
